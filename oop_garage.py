#Project OOP Parking Garage

# Here are some guidelines on constructing your Garage. Your Garage does not need to do exactly this.
# BUT! It should be robust enough for the user to interact with as if they were entering and leaving a parking garage. 
# - take_ticket
# - This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1
# - This should decrease the amount of parking_spaces available by 1
# - pay_for_parking
# - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable
# - If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave
# - This should update the "current_ticket" dictionary key "paid" to True
# -leave_garage
# - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of "Thank You, have a nice day"
# - If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment
# - Once paid, display message "Thank you, have a nice day!"
# - Update parking_spaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)
# - Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)

# Some example attributes:
# - tickets -> list
# - parking_spaces -> list
# - current_ticket -> dictionary
